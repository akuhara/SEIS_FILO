__NOTE: Currently, the software undergoes alpha testing: most functions work as intended but are not thoroughly tested yet. Anythings in codes and documents can change without notification.__

The SEIS_FILO program package aims to carry out transdimensional joint inversion of surface waves and receiver functions for ocean-bottom observatories. The main features are: 

* __Transdimensional MCMC__
    * Automatically determines the number of unknowns (i.e., the number of layers in the structure model).
    * Uncertainty estimates
* __Parallel computing__
    * Paralle tempring technique is available  
* __Ocean layer__
    * Acoustic solution for the ocean layer and elastic solution for solid layers
* __Multiple inputs__
    * Dispersion curves of the fundamental and higher mode Rayleigh waves (Love wave is not implimented yet but is planned)
    * Rayleigh wave ellipticity & admittance (planned)
    * P and S receiver functions with different filter parameters and ray parameters
    * Works fine with any combination of inputs above 
* __Flexible inversion setting__
    * Vp solved or fixed
    * Ocean exists or not
    * Flat or spherical Earth model
    * Solve for noise standard deviation
    * Prior constraint applied or not
* __Easy to visualize__
    * Plot utilities also available
